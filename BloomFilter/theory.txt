A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test
whether an element is a member of a set. For example, checking availability of
username is set membership problem, where the set is the list of all registered
username. The price we pay for efficiency is that it is probabilistic in nature that
means, there might be some False Positive results.
